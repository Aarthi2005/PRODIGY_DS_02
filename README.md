**Task Overview**
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. 
Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

**Iris Dataset Analysis**
This Python script performs data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset. 
The Iris dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

**Description**
The iris_analysis.py script performs the following tasks:

1.Loads the Iris dataset from a URL.
2.Displays the first few rows of the dataset.
3.Checks for missing values and data types.
4.Provides summary statistics of the dataset.
5.Visualizes relationships between variables using scatter plots.
6.Visualizes the distribution of each variable by species using boxplots.

**Output**
The script generates visualizations using Matplotlib to explore relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the Iris dataset.

**Knowledge Gained**
Task 2 provides insights into data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and basic visualization techniques using Pandas and Matplotlib, enhancing skills in data manipulation and interpretation
